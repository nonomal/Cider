> [!WARNING]  
>This project has been archived, and no further updates or support will be provided under any circumstances. We highly recommend switching to [Cider v2](https://cider.sh/downloads/client) for the latest features, improvements, and continued support.  

This repository contains the source code for **Cider v1.x**, a cross-platform Apple Music client built from the ground up by the development team.  

Cider v1 was developed using [Electron.js](https://electronjs.org), [Vue.js 2](https://vuejs.org), and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org).  

**Note:** While distributions may still be available through various third-party sources, first-party builds are no longer provided due to the high volume of support requests for v1. You can compile it following the [insructions outlined in our legacy documentation](https://cider.sh/docs) from our website. Support will not be provided for compiling.
